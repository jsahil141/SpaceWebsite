                        <h2>Saturn</h2>
                       <p> Saturn is the sixth planet from the sun, with the largest planetary rings in the Solar System. It is the second-largest planet after Jupiter, and recently, with many other moons being discovered, it surpassed the number of Jupiter’s moons and is now considered the planet with the most numerous satellites.</p><br>

                        <p> Since ancient times Saturn was known to humanity because of its brightness and closeness to Earth. It’s not possible to give someone credit for the discovery of Saturn, however, the first telescopic observation was conducted by Galileo Galilei in 1610.
Because of the crude telescope available at the time, Galileo failed to observe the rings of Saturn. The discovery of the rings was made by Christiaan Huygens in 1659.</p><br>

                        <p> Saturn is named after the Roman god of harvest and time, the equivalent of the Greek god of time, Cronos.
Out of the five visible planets (Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter), Saturn is the most distant from Earth, at a distance of 10.6 AU and an average of 9.6 AU away from the Sun. Light takes approximately 1 hour and 29 minutes to travel from Saturn and then arrive at us. For an actual and accurate position of Saturn, you can check it up online, as the planet is constantly tracked.
Saturn is the second-largest planet of the Solar System, second only to Jupiter, having a radius of 58.232 km or 36.183 mi, about nine times that of Earth.
It has a diameter of 120.536 km or 74.897 mi, almost 9.5 times bigger than the diameter of Earth and a surface area about 83 times greater.</p><br>

                        <p> The rings of Saturn are the most extensive of any other planet. They cannot be seen without an unaided eye. Generally, only 3 rings can be seen by regular telescopes, powerful telescopes can view 8 rings and when the spacecraft Cassini orbited Saturn, it counted well above 30 rings. It is important to understand that these rings are actually countless since they are comprised of millions of generally small rocks creating illusions of ring systems.</p><br>

                        <p> The ring system of Saturn can extend up to 282.000 km / 175.000 mi from the planet. The rings of Saturn together with the planet itself can fit in the distance between the Earth and the Moon.
It is the most oblate planet in the Solar System, with its equatorial diameter of 120.536 km / 74.897 mi, being greater than the planet’s polar diameter of 108,728 km / 67.560 mi. If viewed from a small telescope it appears flattened.
Saturn has the lowest density of all the planets – 687 kg/m³ – or in other words, it is lighter than water thus if placed on water, it would float.
The low density is attributed to its composition. The planet is largely made up of gases such as hydrogen and helium.
This together with its atmosphere that is composed of ammonia – yellow, ammonia hydrosulfide – orange, and water – white – influence the planet’s colorful appearance of a brownish-yellow.</p><br>
