                        <h2>Uranus</h2>
                       <p> Uranus is the seventh planet discovered in the Solar System that also led to the discovery of the last planet, Neptune they are both referred to as ice giants. Officially recognized in 1781 after many observations in the past, it is the third-largest planet of the Solar System.</p><br>

                        <p> Since ancient times it was not recognized due to its dimness and slow orbit. However, in 1781 Sir William Herschel announced its discovery being the first planet discovered with the help of a telescope.
It was given the name Uranus, after the Greek god of the sky Ouranos.</p><br>

                        <p> It is the only planet whose name is derived directly from a figure of Greek mythology.
The mean apparent magnitude of Uranus is 5.68 with a standard deviation of 0.17, making it near the limit of naked eye visibility.
Uranus is the seventh planet from the Sun, around 1.8 billion miles or 2.9 billion kilometers distance away.
It has the third-largest planetary radius and fourth-largest mass in the Solar System.
It has a radius of 25.362 kilometers or 15.759 miles, and has about 14.5 times the mass of Earth and four times its diameter – about 51.118 kilometers or 31.763 miles.
It is on an average distance of 19.2 AU away from the Sun and currently 18.8 AU away from Earth. Its actual distance can be checked online as Uranus is constantly tracked.</p><br>

                        <p> Its volume is about 63 times greater than Earth’s, which means that 63 Earths can fit inside it.
The gravity on Uranus is about 8.87 m/s² or around 86% of the surface gravity on Earth which is 9.807 m/s².
It orbits the sun quite unusually, being the only planet whose equator is nearly at a right angle to its orbit, with a tilt of 97.77 degrees. Because of this, it rotates in the opposite direction than most planets, from East to West. Venus also does this but Uranus is the only known planet to rotate on its side.</p><br>

                        <p> It takes Uranus 84 years to complete an orbit of the Sun, the longest from all the planets in the solar system.
It also has the shortest day. One rotation on Uranus takes about 17 hours.
Uranus has the coldest planetary atmosphere in the solar system, -224 degrees Celsius;-371 degrees Fahrenheit.
Uranus and Neptune share similar composition, both have bulk chemical compositions which differ from that of the larger gas giants Jupiter and Saturn. Because of this Uranus and Neptune are classified as ice giants rather than gas giants, for easier distinction.</p><br>
