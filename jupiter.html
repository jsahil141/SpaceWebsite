                        <h2>Jupiter</h2>
                       <p> Jupiter is the fifth planet from the Sun and the largest planet of the Solar System. It is the oldest planet of the Solar System thus it was the first to take shape out of the remains of the solar nebula.</p><br>

                        <p> Since it is the fourth brightest object in the sky, Jupiter was observed since ancient times and thus no one can be credited for its discovery. However, the first telescopic observations were conducted by Galileo Galilei in 1609 and in 1610 Galileo also discovered the major moons of Jupiter, but of course not the smaller ones.
Since many cultures observed Jupiter, they all gave it different names but the Roman name remained used in the majority of cultures. Jupiter is named after the principal Roman god, the equivalent of the Greek god Zeus.</p><br>

                        <p> Jupiter is one of the five visible planets (Mercury, Venus, Mars, Saturn), being the fifth most distant from the Sun at an average distance of 5.2 AU, its closest approach is at 4.9 AU and at its farthest 5.4 AU. Its exact position can be checked online since the planet is constantly tracked.
It is the biggest planet of the Solar System, with a mean radius of 43.440 miles / 69.911 km, a diameter at the equator of about 88.846 mi / 142.984 km, and at the poles, the diameter is only 83.082 mi / 133.708 km.
Jupiter is also twice as massive as all the other planets combined, having 318 times the mass of Earth.
The gas giant has a gravity of 24.79 m/s², a little more than twice of Earth. Its powerful gravity has been used to hurl spacecraft into the farthest regions of the solar system.</p><br>

                        <p>Jupiter rotates once every 10 hours – A Jovian day – thus it has the shortest day of all the planets in the solar system.
A Jovian year is about 12 Earth years, quite long in comparison to its short days.
Since Jupiter has a small axial tilt of only 3.13 degrees, it has little seasonal variations.
Jupiter does not have a solid surface being comprised mostly out of swirling gases and liquids such as 90% hydrogen, 10% helium – very similar to the sun.</p><br>

                        <p> A very small fraction of the atmosphere is made up of compounds such as ammonia, sulfur, methane, and water vapor. Jupiter’s atmosphere is the largest planetary atmosphere in the solar system. It makes up almost the entire planet.
It holds a unique place in the history of space exploration since after it was observed through the telescope, some of its moons were also discovered and because of this, their movements were observed thus ending the belief that everything orbited the Earth.
Though it remains the biggest planet, Jupiter has been dethroned as the moon king by Saturn, which now has 82 moons. Jupiter currently has only 79 known satellites.</p><br>
