                        <h2>Mercury</h2>
                       <p> Mercury is the smallest planet in our solar system. It’s just a little bigger than Earth’s moon. It is the closest planet to the sun, but it’s actually not the hottest.</p><br>

                        <p> Along with Venus, Earth, and Mars, Mercury is one of the rocky planets. It has a solid surface that is covered with craters. It has no atmosphere, and it doesn’t have any moons. Mercury likes to keep things simple.

This small planet spins around slowly compared to Earth, so one day lasts a long time. Mercury takes 59 Earth days to make one full rotation. A year on Mercury goes by fast. Because it’s the closest planet to the sun, it doesn’t take very long to go all the way around. It completes one revolution around the sun in just 88 Earth days. If you lived on Mercury, you’d have a birthday every three months!</p><br>

                        <p> A day on Mercury is not like a day here on Earth. For us, the sun rises and sets each and every day. Because Mercury has a slow spin and short year, it takes a long time for the sun to rise and set there. Mercury only has one sunrise every 180 Earth days!</p><br>

                        <p> Since Mercury can be seen without the need of a telescope, many ancient civilizations saw the planet, and as such it is impossible to determine who discovered it first. However, it was first observed with the help of a telescope in early 17th century, by Galileo Galilei.
Galileo’s crude telescope didn’t manage to capture Mercury’s phases, this would be observed later by astronomer Giovanni Zupi in 1639, and thus he discovered that the planet had similar phases like Venus and the Moon.
In ancient times, Mercury was taught as being two different objects in the sky: The Mourning Star and The Evening Star. In Venus’s case, it was also mistakenly believed to be two different things.</p><br>

                        <p> Mercury was named after the Roman messenger god, because of its fast movements around the Sun.
Mercury is the closest planet to the Sun at a distance of 57.91 million kilometers / 35.98 miles or 0.4 AU away. It takes sunlight 3.2 minutes to travel from the Sun to Mercury.
 It orbits around the Sun with a speed of about 29 miles or 47 kilometers per second.
Despite being the smallest terrestrial planet from the Solar System, and in fact the smallest of all the planets, it is the second densest planet in the Solar System, with a density of 5.43 g/cm³.</p><br>
